# Interview Process

1. You and I do an intro call, which is first and foremost and oppertunity for you to ask us questions.
I want you to know and understand the kind of company we are, because interviewing is a time consuming activity for everyone involved.
2. We give you a code sample.  We think it isn't too small or too big.
3. We then have you extend that code sample in a pairing session with us.
4. We have a team interview where we ask you "give me a time when" questions to get a sense of what you value.
(You can do the team interview or code sample first)
