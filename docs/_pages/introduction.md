“It’s a hot market!” we’ve heard it a million times. A hot talent market probably means that you’re getting bombarded with messages asking you to spend time learning about new opportunities even more than you usually do.

We’re a remote first company, so we understand the beauty of asynchronicity. For that reason, we’ve created this doc so you can get to know us on your own time. If and when you’re ready to chat, we’ll be here for you. If the information below resonates with you,  reach out to Amy Kaminski, who leads all things People at amy@emporatitle.com to kick off a conversation.

# Interview Process

1. Introductory phone call - a chance for us to learn more about what you’re looking for, and a time for you to ask questions to dig in and make sure the opportunity at Empora feels like a well-aligned team/role. This is a time for you to ask a ton of questions!
2. Code exercise - we try to make this a reasonable challenge so we’re able to get a sense of your abilities, and so you can get a taste of what types of problems you’d work on if you joined us.
3. Pairing interview - in this session, you’ll meet a couple of additional members of our team and expand on your code sample. We hope this session will help you get a feel for our team and what it would be like to work together.
4. Team interview - in this session, you’ll meet additional members of the team (we try to include folks you haven’t met yet) and they’ll ask you behavioral questions to get a sense of your experience. There will also be plenty of time for you to ask questions!

# Our mission

To ensure real estate customers are treated with respect in an industry-leading precedent for the next 100 years.

# Why customers choose us?

They choose us because of our "Big 4":

1. The best communication in the industry: Our goal is to always communicate deal updates before the customer even wonders “What’s going on with my deal?” Customers should also always understand the process, what will happen next, and what they can expect from us.
2. 100% access and clarity regarding what is happening on your deals: Everything you need for ALL of your deals is in your portal and always up to date.
3. If you’ve given us the information once, you’ll never have to give it again. No matter how a customer sends us information, it should be present and utilized to the fullest extent on every deal they do with Empora.
4. Empora doesn’t charge frivolous fees: We only charge for title insurance premium and the commitment, usually saving customers around 30% on their closing.

# How does software fit into all this?

Real Estate Investors often complain that a huge part of their job is chasing the title company to make sure things are running smoothly. We are building a platform where they can see, in real time, that their deals are moving forward as expected, and we are a title company they won’t have to chase down. We use technology and communication to stay three steps ahead of our clients, so they can focus on what they’re best at.

The goals of our platform are:
1. Eliminate the unnecessary - including paperwork, time, and superfluous fees
2. Scale our process so that the title process is predictable, repeatable, and moves at lightning speed.
